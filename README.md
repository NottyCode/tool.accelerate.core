# Welcome to the Liberty Starter
An application builder to allow you to construct starter applications for building your projects with Liberty.

Liberty Starter is still in its early stages so we will be adding new technologies and capabilities to the page over time. For now, feel free to <a href="http://liberty-starter.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/">try it out</a> and see how quickly you can have a fully fledged application. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions please raise an <a href="https://github.com/WASdev/tool.artisan.core/issues">issue</a> on our GitHub repository.

For an introduction see our <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/blog/2015/11/27/introducing-the-liberty-starter-a-tool-to-get-you-writing-microservices-quickly/">blog post</a>. To learn how the Liberty Starter can be used to create the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/an-evolved-plants-by-websphere-image-service-making-the-break/">image service</a> for the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/starting-evolution-microservices-using-plants-websphere-sample/">Plants by WebSphere evolution</a> from monolith to microservice, see our new <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/creating-image-service-plants-websphere-using-liberty-starter"/>article</a>.
